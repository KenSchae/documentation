## Font
Used a standard font to create TextMeshPro assets. This allows for different font "materials" across a canvas. For example, if you want to use outlines on some text elements but not others, then you need two different assets. One with outlines, the other without.

Right-click the font in the Project window and then Create->TextMeshPro->Font Asset

## Image Masking
Add a UI Image and then add a Mask component to the image. Size the box accordingly, and then make other images the children of the Mask.

An LLM consists of two files
1. Parameter file - this is the BIG file of tokens, it is a compressed version of the trained data
2. Run file - this is the logic of the AI, about 500 lines of code


Three Types of LLM training
1. Pre-training - consumption of large amounts of data and learning structure of language
2. Fine Tuning - providing specific examples of how conversations should render
3. Reinforcement - providing feedback about AI responses


Closed Source Disadvantages
- Privacy and security
- Cost
- Dependency on the internet
- Network latency
- Lack of Transparency
- Bias Risk


Open Source Disadvantages
- Hardware requirements
- Closed source LLMs run better


Quantization - process of reducing an LLM so that it will run on weaker hardware
	Think of quantization like video resolution. 8k, 4k, 1080p, etc

## Implement Azure Functions

### Introduction

>Azure Functions lets you develop serverless applications on Microsoft Azure. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it.

>Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, whereas Azure Logic Apps is a serverless workflow integration platform. Both can create complexÂ _orchestrations_. An orchestration is a collection of functions or steps, called actions in Logic Apps, that are executed to accomplish a complex task.

>Like Azure Functions, Azure App Service WebJobs with the WebJobs SDK is a code-first integration service that is designed for developers. Both are built on Azure App Service and support features such as source control integration, authentication, and monitoring with Application Insights integration.

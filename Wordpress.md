In order to FTP and unzip wordpress it is easiest to make my user id the owner and group of the web directory. Then I can FTP the files, unzip and edit as needed to get wordpress installed

Once I want to go to Wordpress to do work, then I need to make the owner and group www-data so that Apache can install plugins and stuff.

# documentation

This repo contains markdown files that provide documentation for my own reference. I guess in the old days I would have a blog where I write articles with this information, today I use GitHub.

## Cheatsheets

The markdowns in this folder are mostly the steps to accomplish certain tasks or technologies. They are meant to be references but I still tend to use Google to get most of this information.

## Runbooks

These are step by step documents to build out environments. These tend to look like cheatsheets too.

## Organization and Completeness

The files are a little disorganized and many are incomplete. I am slowly working on getting them to a better state.
